## Learning Methods
The program uses the following methods to help us master each concept:
* Peer Learning: We review each other's code and documentation.
* Project-Based Tasks: Every topic includes practical coding projects.

* Daily Standups: We collaborate and problem-solve in small teams.

* Research & Documentation: Independent research is required and encouraged.

* Presentations: We frequently present our work to stakeholders.

* Mentorship: Technical mentors guide us through advanced topics.
